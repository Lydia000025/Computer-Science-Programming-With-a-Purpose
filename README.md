#Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose
#Princeton University
#Coursera

#Description.
The basis for education in the last millennium was ”reading, writing, and arithmetic;” now it is reading, writing, and computing. Learning to program is an essential part of the education of every student, not just in the sciences and engineering, but in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, as well. Beyond direct applications, it is the first step in understanding the nature of computer science’s undeniable impact on the modern world. But computer science is much more than just programming. This collection of video lectures aims to teach fundamental concepts of the discipline, which can serve as a basis for further study of some of the most important scientific ideas of the past century.

#Prerequisites. 
This course is suitable for typical first-year college students. We do not expect preparation beyond what is typically required for other entry-level science and mathematics courses.

#Lectures.
There is one lecture (about 75 minutes each) per week. Each lecture is broken up into about 4–6 segments.

#Readings.
This course is based on the first half of our textbook Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Our companion course Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory and Machines covers material in the second half of the textbook. 

A book published by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne
The online materials available here are designed to be self-contained, but the textbook provides thorough coverage of the material. Addison-Wesley is offering Coursera students a 35% discount when purchased from InformIT. To receive the discount, enter the code COURSERA during checkout.

#Booksite.
The booksite is an online resource associated with the book that is open to everyone and contains a wealth of supplementary information, including synopses of the textbook, answers to some exercises, code, and other resources.

#Quizzes
(graded and required).  Each lecture ends with a graded quiz consisting of a few multiple-choice questions. Some of the questions are fact-based and may require review of the lecture; others require derivations and calculations similar to those presented in lectures.

#Programming assignments (graded and required).
There is one programming assignments associated with each lecture. A programming assignment consists of 3–5 questions, each of which involves writing a Java program.

#Enrichment exercises (ungraded and optional).
Optional selected exercises from the book are associated with each lecture. These are for self-assessment and to focus discussion in the forums. Not everyone is expected to successfully complete every question—some of them are quite challenging and may be difficult for some people to complete on their own.

#Java programming environment. 
You are free to develop your Java programs in any environment that you choose. We provide step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring a novice-friendly programming environment, including OpenJDK 11, IntelliJ IDEA, associated command-line tools, and our textbook libraries. [ OS X, Windows, Linux ]

#Discussion forums.
Ask questions in the discussion forums if you need help; contribute to the forums if you think that you can provide help. Such forums have proven to be an important and fun part of the online course experience. Staff members will monitor these forums.

#Attribution.
These course materials were created by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. Some of the quiz questions are based on Princeton exam questions that were developed with the help of other course staff, but most are original for this course.

#Overview

This course covers the first half of our textbook Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Our companion course   Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory and Machines covers the second half of the textbook. Anyone familiar with Java programming is prepared to take that course, though a quick review of the material in this course may be helpful in introducing our way of doing things.

Each lecture corresponds to a section in the book, so everyone is encouraged to study the corresponding material in the text in conjunction with the lectures and to refer to the associated material in our booksite.

#Week 1
Lecture 1: Basic Programming Concepts. Why program? This lecture addresses that basic question. Then it describes the anatomy of your first program and the process of developing a program in Java using either virtual terminals or an integrated development environment, with some historical context. Most of the lecture is devoted to a thorough coverage of Java's built-in data types, with example programs for each.

#Week 2
Lecture 2: Conditionals and Loops. The if, while, and for statements are Java's fundamental control structures. This lecture is built around short programs that use these constructs to address important computational tasks. Examples include sorting, computing the square root, factoring, and simulating a random process. The lecture concludes with a detailed example illustrating the process of debugging a program.

#Week 3
Lecture 3: Arrays. Computing with a large sequence of values of the same type is extremely common. This lecture describes Java's built-in array data structure that supports such applications, with several examples, including shuffling a deck of cards, the coupon collector test for randomness, and random walks in a grid.

#Week 4
Lecture 4: Input and Output. To interact with our programs, we need mechanisms for taking information from the outside world and for presenting information to the outside world. This lecture describes several such mechanisms: for text, drawings, and animation. Detailed examples covered include fractal drawings that model natural phenomena and an animation of a ball bouncing around in the display window.

#Week 5
Lecture 5: Functions and Libraries. Modular programming is the art and science of breaking a program into pieces that can be individually developed. This lecture introduces functions (Java methods), a fundamental mechanism that enables modular programming. Motivating examples include functions for the classic Gaussian distribution and an application that creates digital music.

#Week 6
Lecture 6: Recursion. A recursive function is one that calls itself. This lecture introduces the concept by treating in detail the ruler function and (related) classic examples, including  the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, the H-tree, and simple models of the real world based on recursion. We show a common pitfall in the use of recursion, and a simple way to avoid it, which introduces a different (related) programming paradigm known as dynamic programming.

#Week 7
Lecture 7: Performance. When you develop a program, you need to be aware of its resource requirements. In this lecture, we describe a scientific approach to understanding performance, where we develop mathematical models describing the running time our programs and then run empirical tests to validate them. Eventually we come to a simple and effective approach that you can use to predict the running time of your own programs that involve significant amounts of computation.

#Week 8
Lecture 8: Abstract Data Types. In Java, you can create your own data types and use them in your programs. In this and the next lecture, we show how this ability allows us to view our programs as abstract representations of real-world concepts. First we show the mechanics of writing client programs that use data types. Our examples involve abstractions such as color, images, and genes. This style of programming is known as object-oriented programming because our programs manipulate objects, which hold data type values.

#Week 9
Lecture 9: Creating Data Types. Creating your own data types is the central activity in modern Java programming. This lecture covers the mechanics (instance variables, constructors, instance methods, and test clients) and then develops several examples, culminating in a program that uses a quintessential mathematical abstraction (complex numbers) to create visual representations of the famous Mandelbrot set.

#Week 10
Lecture 10: Programming Languages. We conclude the course with an overview of important issues surrounding programming languages. To convince you that your knowledge of Java will enable you to learn other programming languages, we show implementations of a typical program in C, C++, Python, and Matlab. We describe important differences among these languages and address fundamental issues, such as garbage collection, type checking, object oriented programming, and functional programming with some brief historical context.

#Beyond
If you're interested in continuing, please sign up for Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory and Machines and then Algorithms, our course that covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.
