Description. The basis for education in the last millennium was ”reading, writing, and arithmetic;” now it is reading, writing, and computing. Learning to program is an essential part of the education of every student, not just in the sciences and engineering, but in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, as well. Beyond direct applications, it is the first step in understanding the nature of computer science’s undeniable impact on the modern world. But computer science is much more than just programming. This collection of video lectures aims to teach fundamental concepts of the discipline, which can serve as a basis for further study of some of the most important scientific ideas of the past century.

Prerequisites. This course is suitable for typical first-year college students. We do not expect preparation beyond what is typically required for other entry-level science and mathematics courses.

Lectures. There is one lecture (about 75 minutes each) per week. Each lecture is broken up into about 4–6 segments.

Readings. This course is based on the first half of our textbook Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Our companion course Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory and Machines covers material in the second half of the textbook. 

A book published by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne
The online materials available here are designed to be self-contained, but the textbook provides thorough coverage of the material. Addison-Wesley is offering Coursera students a 35% discount when purchased from InformIT. To receive the discount, enter the code COURSERA during checkout.

Booksite.  The booksite is an online resource associated with the book that is open to everyone and contains a wealth of supplementary information, including synopses of the textbook, answers to some exercises, code, and other resources.

Quizzes (graded and required).  Each lecture ends with a graded quiz consisting of a few multiple-choice questions. Some of the questions are fact-based and may require review of the lecture; others require derivations and calculations similar to those presented in lectures.

Programming assignments (graded and required).  There is one programming assignments associated with each lecture. A programming assignment consists of 3–5 questions, each of which involves writing a Java program.

Enrichment exercises (ungraded and optional).  Optional selected exercises from the book are associated with each lecture. These are for self-assessment and to focus discussion in the forums. Not everyone is expected to successfully complete every question—some of them are quite challenging and may be difficult for some people to complete on their own.

Java programming environment.  You are free to develop your Java programs in any environment that you choose. We provide step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring a novice-friendly programming environment, including OpenJDK 11, IntelliJ IDEA, associated command-line tools, and our textbook libraries. [ OS X, Windows, Linux ]

Discussion forums.  Ask questions in the discussion forums if you need help; contribute to the forums if you think that you can provide help. Such forums have proven to be an important and fun part of the online course experience. Staff members will monitor these forums.

Attribution.  These course materials were created by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. Some of the quiz questions are based on Princeton exam questions that were developed with the help of other course staff, but most are original for this course.

Acknowledgements.  Thanks are due to the staff at the Office of Information Technology and the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning at Princeton, in particular Jeff Himple and Lance Herrington for the production design, Dan Kearns and Jim Grassi for their help recording and editing the videos, and Laura Shaddock and Mona Fixdal for their help building and maintaining the course materials.
